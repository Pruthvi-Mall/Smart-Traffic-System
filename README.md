üö¶ Advanced Smart Traffic Management System
An interactive web-based simulation that demonstrates how smart cities can manage traffic efficiently using adaptive signal control, live congestion tracking, and incident handling. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on real-time responsiveness and scalability.

üìå Features
Live Traffic Simulation:
Vehicles are generated dynamically at intersections A, B, and C with real-time counts for each approach (N/S/E/W).

Intelligent Signal Control:
Traffic signals adjust automatically based on demand and congestion, mimicking real-world adaptive traffic lights.

Incident Simulation:
Trigger accidents or road closures at any intersection. The system adjusts traffic logic and reflects incidents instantly.

Dashboard Controls:
Start, Stop, and Reset the entire simulation. Live stats display overall congestion, active events, and time elapsed.

System Log Panel:
Real-time logs of simulation activity for transparency and future analysis.

Analytics Section (Conceptual):
Placeholder for future expansion with traffic heatmaps, historical trends, and performance charts.

üß† Purpose
This case study was created to demonstrate:

How web technologies can be used to simulate real-world smart city systems.

The role of automation and logic in adaptive infrastructure.

The foundation for connecting with IoT devices or data analytics in future extensions.
